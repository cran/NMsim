\description{
Simulates _known_ subjects, meaning that it reuses ETA values from
estimation run. This is what is refered to as emperical Bayes
estimates. The .phi file from the estimation run must be found
next to the .lst file from the estimation.This means that ID
values in the (simulation) input data must be ID values that were
used in the estimation too. Runs an \code{$ESTIMATION MAXEVAL=0}
but pulls in ETAs for the ID's found in data. No
\code{$SIMULATION} step is run which may affect how for instance
residual variability is simulated, if at all.
