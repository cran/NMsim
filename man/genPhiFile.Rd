\title{Generate a .phi file for further simulation with Nonmem}
\usage{
genPhiFile(data, file, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset that contains "ID" and all `ETA`s. This can
be obtained by `NMdata::NMscanData`.}

\item{file}{Path to the .phi file to be written.}

\item{overwrite}{If `file` exists already, overwrite it? Default
is `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, character lines (strings) optionally written to
    file
}
\description{
This will typically be used in a couple of different
situations. One is if a number of new subjects have been simulated
and their ETAs should be reused in subsequent simulations. Another
is internally by NMsim when simulating new subjects from models
estimated with SAEM.
