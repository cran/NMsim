# 0.0.6
## New features

* Support for parallelization of simulations added when using PSN. It
used to be possible to run multiple simulations simultaneously in
separate threads. Now single simulation runs can be parallelized on
`sge` type clusters (using `qsub`). See arguments `sge` and `nc`.

## Bugfixes

* A simple mistake would create problems in `genPhiFile()` when having
  more than 10 ETAs in a model. Now fixed.

# 0.0.5
## New features

* Full support for models estimated with SAEM. Especially, simulation
  of "known" subjects, i.e. re-using emperical Bayes estimates, is
  slightly different with these models.

* Experimental support for windows with PsN. `dir.psn` argument has to
  point to a directory where executables `execute` and `update_inits`
  are found. Thanks to Sjoerd Koopman for debugging and testing
  this. Hopefully in future versions, `PsN` will not be needed on
  Windows (like it is not needed on Linux).

* The simulation method called NMsim_known now accepts other `.phi`
  files to use than the .phi file generated by the estimation
  run. This is useful if one wants to reuse subjects generated in a
  previous simulation.

## Other/minor improvements

* NMexec now also copies out the shk (shrinkage estimates) file after
  a run. The files that will by default be copied and reported next to
  the control streams are now `xml`, `ext`, `cov`, `cor`, `coi`,
  `phi`, `shk` - in addition to output table files and the archived
  input data of course.

# 0.0.2
## New features

* NMsim supports `type.sim="typical"` which means all OMEGAS will be
  fixed to zero. This requires the ext file to be present.

* Experimental support for simulation of estimated subjects using
  `type.sim="known"`.
